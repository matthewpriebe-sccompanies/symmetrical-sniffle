## **IMM110**

Description: 
CREATES A REPORT OF P04, P05, P06, P07, W04,
AND W06.                               

THIS PROGRAM READS THROUGH THE IMS-AUTH DATABASE LOOKING FOR  
STATUS'S LISTED ABOVE AND CREATES A REPORT BASED ON WHAT      
COMPANY THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING RUN FOR.               


Schedules: 
*ALL
	LTDALL 


Jobs: 
*110J
	LTD110J

Notes:

The way it is written, It will not create DR Leonards report in AMK110J because the ctl-company-cd = '04' so the sub-company-code is '0' and likewise in DRL110J the ctl-company-cd is 'A4' so the 04 records won't be on the report.

9/28/22: DRL110-01 reports are now found in AMK 110-01 reports since the merging. Used by Tasha Smith


B00 sql - Change Corporate Cd based on company being queried.
Select * from IMS_AUTH
where ((STATUS_CD = 'P' and STATUS_NO in ('04', '05', '06', '07')) or 
(STATUS_CD = 'W' and STATUS_NO in ('04','06'))) and CORPORATE_CD = '4'
order by CORPORATE_CD asc, SUB_COMP_CD asc, ADD_DATE asc;

Parm Card usage: 
CTL-TEST = Used only to change checkpoint from 5000 to 2
CTL-DISPLAY-ON = not used
CTL-UPDATE-SW = not used
CTL-COMPANY-CD = used to distinguish which records to write

THIS PROGRAM SELECTS FROM THE AUTH DB ALL 'P06' UPDATING 
THEM TO 'W06'. IT CALLS IMM108 TO REPORT.

Notes:


Doesn't look like LTD/LSC specifically needs to be handled, as the program is file driven. 

For Figis and MKC, special coding is in there to print discount details to a PRINT-FILE-3 (SYS008) and PRINT-FILE-4 (SYS009), which are not used in DRL or AMK jobs.
