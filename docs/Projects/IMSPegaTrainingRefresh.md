# IMS Pega Training Refresh

## Overview

This project copies production data from Redshift over to the MySQL training environment. The purpose is to provide phone agents and operators with a consistent set of real customer data to use for training purposes. The process is automated through a job controlled by AR team.

The process consists of 5 Glue Jobs.

## Glue Jobs and Tables

|Glue Job | MySqlTables | Redshift |
|---------|--------|--------|
|env-CrdTrainingImsCusEmailExtract | IMS_CUS_EMAIL | oframe_prd_s.ims_cus_email |
|env-dev-CrdTrainingImsMasonCrnExtract | IMS_MASON_CRN | oframe_cdc_prd_s.ims_mason_crn |
|env-CrdTrainingMasonPreferencesExtract| IMS_MASON_PREFERENCES | oframe_prd_s.ims_mason_preferences |
|env-CrdTrainingOrderAuthExtract | IMS_AUTH, IMS_ORDER | oframe_prd_s.ims_order, oframe_prd_s.ims_auth |
|env-CrdTrainingImsCustomerExtract| IMS_CUSTOMER | oframe_prd_s.ims_customer |



## Automic Job
This process is controlled through two Automic schedules:

1.  JOBP.ARTRAIN_LOAD_IMS_GOLDCOPIES: This schedule pulls new and updated production data from the Redshift change-data-capture tables and loads it into the MySQL training "gold copy" tables. It kicks-off the five AWS Glue jobs owned by the Credit team to extract, transform, and load the data.

2.  JOBP.ARTRAIN_IMS_REFRESH: This schedule pushes the data from the MySQL training "gold copy" tables into the main training tables. It runs much more frequently, multiple times per day, to reset the training data. This schedule kicks-off a static load Glue job owned entirely by AR.

*Note*: The JOBP.ARTRAIN_LOAD_IMS_GOLDCOPIES schedule runs less often, only when new customers need to be added or existing customer data needs to be modified in the training environment.

*Note*: The Glue Jobs owned by Credit are only run by the first Automic schedule, JOBP.ARTRAIN_LOAD_IMS_GOLDCOPIES. The second Automic Schedule only calls the static load Glue job which is entirely owned by AR.

## Static Load Table

The Accounts Receivable (AR) team utilizes an AWS Glue job named `env-ARTrainingTableLoad`. This job is designed to transfer data from one MySQL table to another without making any modifications to the data. Essentially, it performs a one-to-one copy operation. 

The source (from) and destination (to) table names are provided as environmental variable arguments when running the Glue job. This job is primarily used to replicate the 'gold copy' tables (the original, unmodified tables) to the main tables that the Pega operators work with.

It allows operators or agents to train, make changes and experiment with the data without affecting the 'gold copy' tables. Once the training session is complete, the environment can be quickly reset to its original state (using the 'gold copy' tables) in preparation for the next batch of trainees.

**Note**: The management and control of this Glue job falls under the responsibility of the AR team, not the Credit team.

## Adding New Customer

The AWS Glue jobs are designed to fetch a list of customer scenarios from a file stored in an S3 bucket named `env-training-scenarios-colonybrands-east1`. These customer scenarios are specifically chosen by the phone operators teams for training purposes. 

In addition to the customer data, a specific date is also passed into the Glue Job. This date is used to ensure that the Change Data Capture (CDC) data being retrieved corresponds to the same date.

Any customer read in through the file will be added to the 'gold copy', but not removed. For instance, let's consider a scenario where the job is run twice. During the first run, the input file contains data for 10 customers. These customers are added to the 'gold copy' tables. Now, for the second run, the input file has been updated and contains 8 different customers. After the second run, the 'gold copy' tables will contain data for a total of 18 customers (10 from the first run and 8 from the second run).

The structure of the customer file is straightforward and might look something like this:

## Anonymization

For two of our glue jobs, env-CrdTrainingImsCustomerExtract and env-CrdTrainingImsCusEmailExtract we have to anonymize the names and email addresses of the customers. We do this with the transform step in the job. 

The code chooses a new name based on the last four digits of the customer number. Depending on the customer number this gives us apporximently 10,000 different name options.

# Anonymizing Customer Data in Glue Jobs

Two of our AWS Glue jobs, `env-CrdTrainingImsCustomerExtract` and `env-CrdTrainingImsCusEmailExtract`, anonymize sensitive customer data. This is done to protect customer privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

During the data transformation step, the names and email addresses of customers are replaced with anonymized versions. The code chooses a new name based on the last four digits of the customer number.

Please note that the original customer data is not modified or deleted. The anonymization process only affects the copies of the data used in the training environment.

*Note*: The order of the first and last names in the list are imporatnt. Each name is indexed from 0 to 100. If the order of the names change, the new customer name will change on subsecrent runs.
